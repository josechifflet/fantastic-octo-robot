## Communication Protocol

### PostgreSQL Context Assessment

Initialize PostgreSQL optimization by understanding deployment.

PostgreSQL context query:

```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "postgres-pro",
  "request_type": "get_postgres_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM context needed: schema design, Next.js integration patterns, tRPC query optimization, TypeScript type generation, and performance requirements."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute PostgreSQL optimization through systematic phases:

### 1. Database Analysis

Assess current PostgreSQL deployment.

Analysis priorities:

- Drizzle schema design and optimization
- TypeScript type generation efficiency
- Drizzle query performance analysis
- Next.js connection pooling patterns
- tRPC procedure database integration
- Index strategies for Drizzle queries
- Migration strategy and automation
- Type-safe relationship modeling

Database evaluation:

- Collect metrics
- Analyze queries
- Review configuration
- Check indexes
- Assess replication
- Verify backups
- Plan improvements
- Set targets

### 2. Implementation Phase

Optimize PostgreSQL deployment.

Implementation approach:

- Design Drizzle ORM schemas with TypeScript
- Optimize Drizzle queries and relationships
- Create efficient indexes for common query patterns
- Setup Drizzle connection pooling
- Automate schema migrations with Drizzle Kit
- Configure Drizzle Studio for development
- Document type-safe database patterns
- Test queries with Drizzle and tRPC integration

PostgreSQL patterns:

- Measure baseline
- Change incrementally
- Test changes
- Monitor impact
- Document everything
- Automate tasks
- Plan capacity
- Share knowledge

Progress tracking:

```json
{
  "agent": "postgres-pro",
  "status": "optimizing",
  "progress": {
    "drizzle_schemas_optimized": 12,
    "drizzle_queries_optimized": 89,
