# Core Development Subagents

Core Development subagents are your essential toolkit for building modern applications from the ground up. These specialized agents cover the entire development spectrum - from backend services to frontend interfaces, from mobile apps to desktop applications, and from simple APIs to complex distributed systems.

## ðŸŽ¯ When to Use Core Development Subagents

Use these subagents when you need to:

- **Build new applications** from scratch with proper architecture
- **Implement complex features** that require deep technical expertise
- **Design scalable systems** that can grow with your needs
- **Create beautiful UIs** that provide exceptional user experiences
- **Develop real-time features** for interactive applications
- **Modernize legacy systems** with current best practices
- **Optimize performance** across the entire stack

## ðŸ“‹ Available Subagents

### [**backend-developer**](backend-developer.md) - Server-side expert for scalable APIs

Your go-to specialist for building robust server applications, RESTful APIs, and microservices. Excels at database design, authentication systems, and performance optimization. Perfect for creating the backbone of your application with Node.js, Python, Java, or other backend technologies.

**Use when:** Building APIs, designing databases, implementing authentication, handling business logic, or optimizing server performance.

### [**frontend-developer**](frontend-developer.md) - UI/UX specialist for React, Vue, and Angular

Master of modern web interfaces who creates responsive, accessible, and performant user experiences. Expert in component architecture, state management, and modern CSS. Transforms designs into pixel-perfect, interactive applications.

**Use when:** Creating web interfaces, implementing complex UI components, optimizing frontend performance, or ensuring accessibility compliance.

### [**fullstack-developer**](fullstack-developer.md) - End-to-end feature development

The versatile expert who seamlessly works across the entire stack. Builds complete features from database to UI, ensuring smooth integration between frontend and backend. Ideal for rapid prototyping and full feature implementation.

**Use when:** Building complete features, prototyping applications, working on small to medium projects, or when you need unified development across the stack.

### [**api-designer**](api-designer.md) - tRPC and REST API architect

The architect who designs beautiful, intuitive, and type-safe APIs. Expert in tRPC procedures, REST principles, API versioning, and comprehensive documentation. Ensures your APIs are developer-friendly, type-safe, and future-proof.

**Use when:** Designing tRPC routers, creating type-safe API procedures, implementing API standards, or creating comprehensive API documentation.

## ðŸš€ Quick Selection Guide

| If you need to...                      | Use this subagent       |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Build tRPC APIs with database          | **backend-developer**   |
| Create a responsive React UI           | **frontend-developer**  |
| Develop a complete Next.js application | **fullstack-developer** |
| Design a new tRPC API structure        | **api-designer**        |

## ðŸ’¡ Common Combinations

**Full-Stack Next.js Application:**

- Start with **api-designer** for tRPC API structure
- Use **backend-developer** for tRPC router implementation
- Employ **frontend-developer** for React UI development
- Complete with **fullstack-developer** for end-to-end features

## ðŸŽ¬ Getting Started

1. **Choose the right subagent** based on your specific needs
2. **Provide clear context** about your project requirements
3. **Specify your tech stack** preferences if any
4. **Describe your constraints** (performance, scalability, timeline)
5. **Let the subagent guide you** through best practices and implementation

Each subagent comes with:

- Deep expertise in their domain
- Knowledge of current best practices
- Ability to work with your existing codebase
- Focus on clean, maintainable code
- Understanding of production requirements

## ðŸ“š Best Practices

- **Start with architecture:** Use API designer before implementation
- **Iterate frequently:** Work with subagents in short cycles for better results
- **Combine expertise:** Use multiple subagents for complex projects
- **Follow conventions:** Each subagent knows the best practices for their domain
- **Think production-ready:** All subagents consider scalability, security, and maintenance
