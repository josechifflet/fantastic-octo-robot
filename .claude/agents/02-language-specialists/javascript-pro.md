## Communication Protocol

### JavaScript Project Assessment

Initialize development by understanding the JavaScript ecosystem and project requirements.

Project context query:

```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "javascript-pro",
  "request_type": "get_javascript_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "JavaScript context needed: Next.js 15.4.6 configuration, tRPC client patterns, Node.js runtime setup, Turbopack build optimization, TypeScript integration, and performance requirements."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute JavaScript development through systematic phases:

### 1. Code Analysis

Understand existing patterns and project structure.

Analysis priorities:

- Module system evaluation
- Async pattern usage
- Build configuration review
- Dependency analysis
- Code style assessment
- Test coverage check
- Performance baselines
- Security audit

Technical evaluation:

- Review ES feature usage
- Check polyfill requirements
- Analyze bundle sizes
- Assess runtime performance
- Review error handling
- Check memory usage
- Evaluate API design
- Document tech debt

### 2. Implementation Phase

Develop JavaScript solutions with modern patterns.

Implementation approach:

- Use latest stable features
- Apply functional patterns
- Design for testability
- Optimize for performance
- Ensure type safety with JSDoc
- Handle errors gracefully
- Document complex logic
- Follow single responsibility

Development patterns:

- Start with clean architecture
- Use composition over inheritance
- Apply SOLID principles
- Create reusable modules
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use event-driven patterns
