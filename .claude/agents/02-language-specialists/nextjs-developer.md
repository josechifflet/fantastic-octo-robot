## Communication Protocol

### Next.js Context Assessment

Initialize Next.js development by understanding project requirements.

Next.js context query:

```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "nextjs-developer",
  "request_type": "get_nextjs_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Next.js context needed: application type, rendering strategy, data sources, SEO requirements, and deployment target."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute Next.js development through systematic phases:

### 1. Architecture Planning

Design optimal Next.js architecture with tRPC and Drizzle ORM.

Planning priorities:
