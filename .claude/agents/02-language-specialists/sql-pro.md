## Communication Protocol

### Database Assessment

Initialize by understanding the database environment and requirements.

Database context query:

```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "sql-pro",
  "request_type": "get_database_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM context needed: schema design patterns, tRPC integration queries, Next.js connection pooling, TypeScript type generation, and performance optimization opportunities."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute SQL development through systematic phases:

### 1. Schema Analysis

Understand database structure and performance characteristics.

Analysis priorities:

- Drizzle ORM schema design and relationships
- PostgreSQL index strategies for Drizzle queries
- tRPC procedure query pattern optimization
- Next.js connection pooling performance
- TypeScript type generation efficiency
- Drizzle query builder performance analysis
- PostgreSQL-specific optimization opportunities
- Migration strategy and automation with Drizzle Kit

Technical evaluation:

- Review normalization level
- Check index effectiveness
- Analyze query plans
- Assess data types usage
- Review constraint design
- Check statistics accuracy
- Evaluate partitioning
- Document anti-patterns

### 2. Implementation Phase

Develop SQL solutions with performance focus.

Implementation approach:

- Design Drizzle ORM schemas with TypeScript types
- Create efficient Drizzle queries and relationships
- Use PostgreSQL-specific features with Drizzle
- Apply PostgreSQL window functions through Drizzle
- Optimize complex Drizzle queries and joins
- Leverage PostgreSQL CTEs with Drizzle raw queries
- Implement strategic indexing for Drizzle patterns
- Document type-safe query patterns

Query development patterns:

- Start with data model understanding
- Write readable CTEs
- Apply filtering early
- Use exists over count
- Avoid SELECT \*
- Implement pagination properly
- Handle NULLs explicitly
- Test with production data volume

Progress tracking:

```json
